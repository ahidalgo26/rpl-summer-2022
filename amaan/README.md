**Project name:** Robotics Dashboard Web App for Laboratory Monitoring   
**Advisor:** Arvind Ramanathan   
**Email:** amaan.khan@anl.gov   

## Project description
In the secure biosystems lab, there are many robots that are in play. It is very difficult to control and debug all the robots separately using command-line-interfaces. Therefore, I am developing a Web Dashboard App that will allow users to view various data visualizations, log outputs, messages from ROS topics, camera outputs, and being able to control the various robots from the app.

## Daily Log

### Friday, 6.24.22
* Installed ROS on a Ubuntu Virtual Machine
* Weekly Meeting in rpl
* Met with Rory and planned out how to create the publisher/subscriber model with the dasboard
* Journal Club - took notes as the scribe

### Monday, 6.27.22
* Finished writing publisher.py and began writing subscriber.py for having the camera publish frames to a ROS topic and have the subscriber subscribe to the topic and send those camera frames to the dashboard when possible.
* Read on how ROS Workspace Packages work
* Had weekly meeting with Carla, Frank, Dana, and Mariam where we discussed our progress on our projects
* Met with Mariam to decide on a Journal Club article since we are presenting this week.
* Began reading journal club article
* Met with Rory and showed my progress so far, and helped clear any confusion I had. Told me to upload my code under `rpl-camera-vision/rpl_cv/dashbaord`
* **TODO:**    
  - [x] Finish reading journal club article in depth and split up work for presentation with Mariam tomorrow
  - [x] Create directory 'dashboard' under `AD-SDL/rpl-camera-vision/rpl_cv/` and put your dashboard code there
  - [x] Finish writing subscriber.py
  - [x] Create a ROS workspace and package by following this [tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html#new-directory)

### Tuesday, 6.28.22
* Read journal club article in depth and took notes
* Met with Mariam to split up the work for the journal club presentation
* Rory was able to get `opencv` and `rclpy` python packages working on the NUC so I was able to test out my code and debug issues
* Worked on writing subscriber.py and moved code to rpl-camera-vision repo (have not made a pull request yet - only pushed to my fork for now)

### Wednesday, 6.29.22
* Worked on subscriber.py
* Worked on taking notes for journal club article

### Thursday, 6.30.22
* Finished writing subscriber.py
* Created ROS package and workspace -- ran into an error and spent time debugging it
* Made journal club article presentation

## Friday, 7.1.22
* Made finishing touches on journal club presentation & met with Mariam to go over it
* Weekly RPL Meeting
* Gave journal club presentation

## Tuesday, 7.5.22
* Spent time debugging the ROS package/workspace error
* Had weekly meeting with Carla and team

## Wednesday 7.6.22
* Fixed ROS package/workspace error
* ran into few bugs w/ publisher and subscriber code so spent time on trying to fix them
* Worked on personal website and resume on overleaf since Raf suggested we create a personal website and create resume on overleaf

## Thursday, 7.7.22
* Got publisher & subscriber successfully sending images b/w each other. 
* Met with Rory and we discussed methods to send the data/images from subscriber to the dashboard. Decided to use a socket connection. Rory explained to me how that will work
* Began writing code for the socket server

## Friday, 7.8.22
* Finished writing the socket server code and ran into a few bugs so spent time fixing them. There was one bug that I could not fix by the end of the day
* Meeting at 11am w/ RPL group
* Journal Club at 2pm

## Monday, 7.11.22
* Had weekly meeting with Carla and team - updated on progress
* Socket server portion successfully works now. Fixed a bug where it kept saying that the connection/port is already in use. I had tried changing ports but it never fixed it. Finally realized that if I turned the 'debug' status to False in the Flask App it will fix the error. 
* Dashboard app with the publisher and subscriber nodes now work successfully. Publisher sends frames to a ros topic, where the subscriber listens in on that topic, and when new frames arrive, it sends it through a socket server to the dashboard, which then displays the live video feed successfully.
* Gave a live demo of my dashboard app working with the publisher + subscriber + socket-server to Rory and Dr. Ramanathan.
* Rory and I discussed next steps to do.
* **TODO**    
  - [ ] Clean up code, comment/document code, rename files/packages to be better, remove unncessary files, and commit + push everything to your forked repo.    
  - [ ] Create pull request w/ your forked repo   
  - [ ] NEW Feature: Create a way for the dashboard to have a button that when you click, it sends a message to a ROS topic (e.g., "log_topic"), and then create a subscriber on the NUC that subscribes to that ros topic and prints out the messages whenever it receives it.
