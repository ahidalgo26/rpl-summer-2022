**Project name**: Pyhamilton Protocol Implementation on Hudson 

**Advisors**: Casey Stone, Priyanka Setty, Abe Stroka, Jeff Dewey

**Email**: ahidalgo@anl.gov
## Project description 
For this project, we will reproduce one of the biological experiments presented in this paper using the Python interface that has been developed for the Hudson SOLO liquid handler and Hudson SoftLinx integration system. We aim to prove that our completely open-source Python API is capable of executing the same biological experiments as Pyhamilton with similar results. Students on this project will also contribute to the growing library of biological protocols written for our Hudson robotic experimentation platform. 
## Diary
### 6/27/22
* Started to write the python code for the PyHamilton protocol. 

### 6/28/22
* Finished the Python code for the PyHamilton protocol (assay plate and dilution plate steps) 
* Had a meeting with Casey to discuss the code and had to make some changes to make the code less time consuming.

### 6/29/22
* We started to write the code for the dilution plate, transfering cell from the stock cells plate to the dilution plate. 
* Worked on figuring out the different volumes to use of the nutrients. 
* Looked for more paper about DNA Assembly for Pryianka's project. 

### 6/30/22 
* I attended the a meeting about the basics of DNA assembly and how one might write code to execute this workflow on the Opentrons OT-2s. 
* We finished the code for the dilution plate with the updated concentrations for each nutrient and media. 
* We made final changes to the code and made sure we had everything mapped out for the assay plate. 
* I attended my student connects meeting.

### 7/01/22
* Halona, Gillin and I met to create our slides for the third summer student meeting. 
* I attended the summer students meeting and presented the progress we have made with the project, our challenges and our next steps. 
* I attended the journal club and was the scribbe (took notes of the presentation). 

### 7/05/22
* Worked remotley reading the artcle for my journal club presentation, writting some of the steps down for Pryianka's project and making sure our code was not missing anything. 

### 7/06/22
* Took a seminar on how to prepare our posters 
* Met with Casey to reviwe our code 
* Went to the Biology building and tested the hso files and fixed a few mistakes. 
* Found out that the pippets only hold a max volume of 180 so we knew we had to do more loops to get the correct volume on each well. 

### 7/07/22
* Worked on my Journal Club presentation 
* Met with Carla to discuss the paper for my journal club presentation 
* Worked on fixing the code for the dilution plate (getting the correct volume and doing the correct amount of loops for each step in orther to get the desired final volume for every well).
